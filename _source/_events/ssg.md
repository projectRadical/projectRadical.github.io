A Radical New Interdisciplinary Space for Sonification invites you to join researchers
from Newcastle University and Northumbria University Newcastle for an evening of sounds, texts, and noises in the form of performances, talks, spatial audio, and sonifications.

**Note, due to unforeseen circumstances we have had to postpone the event planned for 26 November. This will be rescheduled for early in the new year.**
